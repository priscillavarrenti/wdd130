            <p> Hello! My name is Priscilla Mariel Varrenti, and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
                As a Web Fundamentals student, I'm excited to learn about web development and 
                everything technology related, and I also considered this opportunity as a great way
                of growing my creativity and experience.</p>

            <p>Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina. It's also one of the biggest cities in the eastern of this country.
                One of the things that portray them is their food, passion, especially when it comes to football; 
                their frendly people, and their beautiful neighborhoods, such as San Telmo and La Boca which are 
                full of character and charm.
